        <h5>During my 26 months in Belize, I visited many different amazing destinations that I am going to outline in this site.  Some of my favorites and most recommened are: Placencia, Caye Caulker, and San Ignacio</h5>
        <br><br>
        
        
        <ul>
            <li>Getting around</li>
                <p>   One thing that I loved about Belize is that is it not too difficult to get around.  All of the towns have fairly reliable bus connections for prices around $5bz from town to town.  Click <a href="http://ansoncfit.com/wp-content/uploads/Belize_Transit_Map1.png" target = '_blank'> here to see a map</a> with the general transportation connections.  Buses leave major towns roughly every hour.  The less popular routes may have a bus every 2 or 3 hours.  Local routes may only leave once a day or every other day.</p>
                <p>   Water Taxis are common from Belize City if you want to get to Caye Caulker or to San Pedro Town.  They leave many times a day, take 45 mins to Caye Caulker, 1.5 hours to San Pedro, and cost about $30bz for a one way ticket if I remember correctly.  There is also a water taxi, the Hokey Pokey Water Taxi, which takes 30 minutes and runs between Placencia and Independance/Mango Creek that is about $10.</p>
                <p>   No matter where you are going, if you start at the Belize International Airport, there is one recommendation I have.  Taking a taxi the 25 minutes to the Belize City bus station or the water taxis will cost you about $25 bucks.  If you take a taxi just 2.7 km from the airport to the highway, you can wait for a bus to pass, going either north to Orange Walk or south to Belize City, and save at least 20 bucks!  It may take a bit longer, but its the way locals get around and the taxis are almost a racket.</p>

            <li><a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Placencia" target = '_blank'>Placencia</a></li>   
                <p>   Over the 26 months, I visited Placencia 4 times (and I'm going back a fifth!).  Placencia village is a calm beach spot with great restaurants and bars, a variety of accommodations, and plenty to do.  Rent bikes/kayaks, learn to scuba dive, just casually snorkel, or kick back on the beach with an ice cold Belikin, Belize's national beer -- in Placencia you can have it all.  The night life scene is sparse, as this is a smaller village, but there are a few bars with live music and good vibes, most notably the Tipsy Tuna. </p>
                <p>   If you are looking to do a snorkel tour, I went a few times with Spalsh Dive Center, who runs great half and full day tours.  They also have scuba certification classes that some friends took and definitely recommend.</p>
                <p>   Hotel/cabanas are fairly resonably priced in Placencia.  The Sea Spray hotel is very affordable at around $35 and adequate for the price.  I also stayed at Lydia's Guesthouse, though I'm unsure if this place is still around.  Prices at Lydia's were around $15 a room.</p>

            <li><a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/San_Ignacio_(Belize)" target = '_blank'> San Ignacio</a></li>
                <p>   San Ignacio is an awesome, cool weather town (by Belizean standards) in the west close to Guatemala.  Close to multiple mayan temples and the amazing Actun Tunichil Muknal (ATM) cave, San Ignacio is a good base for those looking for adventure.  The two ruins of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xunantunich" target = '_blank'> Xunantunich</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahal_Pech" target = '_blank'> Cahal Pech</a> are close to town and both easily visited in one day.</p>
                <p>   The largest standing structure in Belize (at least it was in 2014) was the mayan temple of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracol" target = '_blank'> Caracol</a>.  Deep in the forest, 2 hours or so from San Ignacio, lies an ancient capital of the mayans.  On a clear day, you can see the peak of Tikal's tallest temples from Caracol's summit with binoculars.  I would say visiting Caracol was on par with Tikal across the border in Guatemala.</p>
                <p>   My hotel of choice in San Ignacio is Venus Hotel.  It is located right in the middle of everything on the main streets and has clean, realatively cheap rooms.  The location is unbeatable, being close to the bus station, tour companies, cafes and restaurants, the high bridge across the river, and the central park.</p>

            <li><a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Caye_Caulker" target = '_blank'> Caye Caulker</a></li>
                <p>   Caye Caulker is another sleepy, laid back tropical paradise roughly 1.5 hours from the Airport.  While it may not have the same beatiful sandy beaches that Placencia and Hopkins have, Caye Caulker is quick to get to and has everything you could want for a small island getaway.  Numerous hotels, affordable restaurants and bars, and a relaxing vibe make your stay on Caye Caulker what people dream of when thinking about a Caribbean vacation.</p>
                <p>   One of the most popular spots to visit is called the split.  Caye Caulker used to be connected to another island, but slowly the tides and currents have widened the gap at the north end of the island.  Now there is a bar with plenty to drink and great places to lounge, both in the water and on the docks.  You must visit the split on your trip to Caye Caulker (its hard not to casue the island is so small!)</p>
                <p>   With a few more nightlife options than Placencia, I think of Caye Caulker as being the party destination (with the exception of San Pedro Town on Abergris Caye).  Caye Caulker has nice sunrises and sunsets as you have water to the east and the west.</p>

            <li>Border Crossings</li>
            <p>   While in Belize I crossed at both major crossings, in and out of both Mexico and Guatemala.  There are a decent amount of money changers who offer decent enough rates while still making a profit.  Both crossings are relatively quick as there is not a ton of foot traffic.  In my experience, the crossings never took much more than 30 minutes.</p>
            <p>   Imigration and customs at the International Airport are fairly quick as well.</p>
            <br><br>
